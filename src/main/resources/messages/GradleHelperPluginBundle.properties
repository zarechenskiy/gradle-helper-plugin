documentation.dependency.declaration.level.api=In this method you declare dependencies which are transitively exported to consumers, for compile time and runtime.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.implementation=In this method you declare dependencies which are purely internal and not meant to be exposed to consumers (they are still exposed to consumers at runtime).
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.compile.only=In this method you declare dependencies which are required at compile time, but not at runtime. This typically includes dependencies which are shaded when found at runtime.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.compile.only.api=In this method you declare dependencies which are required at compile time by your module and consumers, but not at runtime. This typically includes dependencies which are shaded when found at runtime.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.runtime.only=In this method you declare dependencies which are only required at runtime, and not at compile time.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.test.implementation=In this method you declare dependencies which are used to compile tests.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.test.compile.only=In this method you declare dependencies which are only required at test compile time, but should not leak into the runtime. This typically includes dependencies which are shaded when found at runtime.
documentation.dependency.declaration.level.test.runtime.only=In this method you declare dependencies which are only required at test runtime, and not at test compile time.
